Gab Captcha 2 is a simple captcha plugin for fighting spam in WordPress comments.

== Description ==

<p>
Gab Captcha 2 is a simple, easy-to-solve and efficient captcha plugin for fighting spam in WordPress comments.
</p>

<p>
It adds an easy Turing test before each comment form. The Turing test consists of emphasized characters (red by default) that you must type in a text field. The plugin can be configured in your administration area.
</p>

<p>
The captcha can be displayed using JavaScript for maximum security (recommended) but can also be displayed without using any JavaScript code. This can be configured in the the plugin settings.
</p>

<p>
You can choose to insert (or not insert) the comments into the database on failure to provide a valid solution. Inserting comments on failure can be useful if you want to be sure that blocked comments are really spam. On the other hand, choosing not to insert the comments on failure can lower your database usage as writing to the database is an expensive process.
</p>

<p>
On failure to provide a valid solution, a visitor will have the opportunity to try again and will not loose his comment.
</p>

<p>
Gab Captcha 2 currently comes in three languages: English (default), Russian (partial) and French. You are welcome to propose your own translation or to update existing ones, especially the English one as I am not a native English speaker.
</p>

<p>
Important notes:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Depending on your settings, this plugin may requires Javascript to be able to post a comment</li>
<li>This plugin can automatically approve valid comments depending on your settings</li>
<li>This plugin requires PHP 5</li>
</ol>

== Installation ==

</p>

<ol>
	<li>Change the options to fit your needs in the 'Settings > Gab Captcha 2' menu in your Wordpress administration area</li>
	<li>If you don't want to receive an email after each spam has been catched:
		<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
			<li>Go to the 'Settings > Discussion' menu
				<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
					<li>Tick the following checkboxes:
						<ul>
							<li>"E-mail me whenever > Anyone posts a comment"</li>
							<li>"Before a comment appears > An administrator must always approve the comment"</li>
							<li>"Before a comment appears > Comment author must have a previously approved comment"</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

<p>
You will now receive an email only after a valid comment has been posted.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Gab Captcha unbeatable by spambots? =

Definitely not. But it stopped all my spam as of today (getting about 100 spams every single day).

= Can I change some settings for Gab Captcha 2? =

Yes. Go to the 'Settings > Gab Captcha 2' menu in your Wordpress administration area.

= Why Gab Captcha 2 is not translated in my language? =

Most probably because nobody submitted a translation for your language yet. But you can help:
1. Go to read http://www.gabsoftware.com/tips/a-guide-for-wordpress-plugins-translators-gettext-poedit-locale
2. The POT file is located in the "lang" sub-directory of Gab Captcha 2
3. Then send me your translated file.
Note: do not edit .po files by hand. Use an appropriate tool such as Poedit and send me both the resulting .po and .mo files.
